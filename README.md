# BDC_Upper_Bounds_GPU

This repository contains GPU-accelerated implementations for computing **upper bounds on the capacity of the Binary Deletion Channel (BDC)** using the **Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm (BAA)**. The approach is based on [this](https://jmlribeiro.github.io/bdc-baa.pdf) work and extends a [previous implementation](https://github.com/ittai-rubinstein/BDC_Upper_Bounds) by Ittai Rubinstein and Roni Con.

The main contributions of this repository are:
- Several algorithmic optimizations of BAA for the BDC.
- Massive GPU parallelization using CUDA.
- The ability to study more challenging parameter regimes than previously possible.

---

## Problem Setting

We study a binary deletion channel denoted by BDC_{n,k}:

- An input binary string of length n is transmitted.
- The channel uniformly at random selects a subset of k positions.
- The selected bits are kept (in order), while the remaining bits are deleted.
- The output is a binary string of length k .

The goal is to compute upper bounds on the channel capacity C_{n,k} of BDC_{n,k} and, through some theoretical results (see [this](https://jmlribeiro.github.io/bdc-baa.pdf)), upper bounds for the classic binary deletion channel of deletion probability d.

## Repository Structure

### `backend/`

This folder contains the full implementation of the optimized Blahut–Arimoto algorithm for the channel BDC_{n,k}.

#### `BAA.cu`
- Implements the optimized Blahut–Arimoto algorithm for the binary deletion channel.
- Includes GPU-specific optimizations and parallelization.
- For a more in-depth discussion of the implementation, follow the [this](https://jmlribeiro.github.io/bdc-baa.pdf) paper and read the comments in the code.

#### `generate_bit_transition_cache.cpp`
- Generates cache files named `cache_n_k`, stored in the `transition_counts/` folder.
- Each cache file encodes a matrix where the entry corresponding to a pair of strings `x` and `y` counts how many times the k-bit string `y` appears as a subsequence of the n-bit string `x`.
- These cache files are used to efficiently compute transition probabilities between input strings `x` and output strings `y`, as described in the underlying paper.

#### `utils.cc` and `cache_io.h`
- Provide utilities for:
  - Loading cache files from disk.
  - Managing cache data in memory during execution.

#### `test_bit_baa.cu`
- The main entry point for running the Blahut–Arimoto algorithm.
- User-configurable parameters:
  - `n`: input string length.
  - `k`: output string length.
  - `a`: tolerance threshold for convergence of the BAA estimate.
- The algorithm runs until the convergence criterion is met.
- Supports:
  - Starting from a uniform input distribution, or
  - Loading a previously saved input distribution from disk.
- The current input distribution is saved to disk every 100 iterations by default (this interval can be changed).

---

### `distributions/`

- Stores saved input distributions.
- These distributions can be reused to initialize future runs of the algorithm.

## generating the cache files

### 1. Run:
Run the executable `generate_bit_transition_cache`:
```bash
./generate_bit_transition_cache n k
```
If you want to estimate the capacity C_{n',k'} of BDC_{n',k'} for specific values input length `n'` and output length `k'`, run the above line of code with n = k = (n'+1)/2. This will generate all the transition matrices between an input `x` and an output `y` for all input sizes less than or equal to `n` and output size less than or equal to `k`, which our implementation uses to estimate C_{n',k'}.


## Running the Blahut–Arimoto Algorithm

### 1. Configure Parameters
Edit `test_bit_baa.cu` and set:
- Desired values of the input length `n`, the number of retained bits `k`, and tolerance threshold `a`.
- Whether to start from a uniform distribution or load one from file (`read_from_file` flag).

### 2. Install CUDA
Make sure the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit is installed:
```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

### 3. Compile
Compile the CUDA code using `nvcc`:
```bash
nvcc -arch=? --extended-lambda -std=c++17 backend/*.cc backend/*.cu -o test_bit_baa
```
Replace ? with the appropriate architecture of your GPU. For example, if you have an RTX 5090, use sm_89.

### 3. Run
Run the executable:
```bash
./test_bit_baa
```

## Downloading Input Distributions

[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17jwDnhdhlL6CTP9mE2dC7aoKNJ81NfeF) you can find (almost) optimal input distributions for \( C_{29,k} \) and \( C_{31,k} \).

Note that the distribution files for C_{31,k} are large (approximately **11 GB** each).

To start a simulation from one of these distributions:
1. Download the desired distribution file.
2. Place it in the `distributions/` folder.
3. Set the `read_from_file` flag to `true` in `test_bit_baa.cu`.
4. Run the program as usual.
