# BDC_Upper_Bounds_GPU
This repository contains implementations for computing upper bounds on the capacity of the Binary Deletion Channel (BDC) for a fixed input length n and output length k, based on [this]() work. The work extends a [previous approach](https://github.com/ittai-rubinstein/BDC_Upper_Bounds), by Ittai Rubinstein and Roni Con, based on the Blahutâ€“Arimoto algorithm by adding several optimizations that allow the study of more challenging parameter regimes.

To make the computation feasible for larger values of n and k, we employ new algorithmic and computational techniques:

- GPU acceleration

- Efficient subsequence and supersequence enumeration to compute BAA updates more efficiently.

- Using codeword symmetry to reduce the number of cases considered.



[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17jwDnhdhlL6CTP9mE2dC7aoKNJ81NfeF) you can find the (almost) optimal input distributions for C_{29,k} obtained for a tolerance of a = 0.005. If you want to run a simulation starting from one of this distributions, add the distribution file to the folder "distributions" and turn the "read_from_file" flag to value "true" when running the file "test_bit_baa.cu"
